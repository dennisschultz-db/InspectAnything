# InspectAnything

This app is for inspections/assessments/surveys/audits/checklists/etc.

It uses Lightning Components, aimed at Salesforce1 or LightningExperience (AppPage and RecordDetail) context.

Treat this as code you found on the side of the road, with no commitment of support from Salesforce or me, though I do appreciate PRs and issues opened.
